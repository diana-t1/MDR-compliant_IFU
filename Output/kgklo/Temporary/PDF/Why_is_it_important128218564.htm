        <p>MDR applies to all medical devices sold or used in the EU, including implants, diagnostic tools, and software-based medical technologies. Compliance with MDR is essential for manufacturers to legally market their products in Europe.</p>
        <p>A properly prepared <b>Instructions for Use (IFU)</b> document is not just about providing guidance—it is a <b>critical component of Medical Device Regulation (MDR) compliance</b>. Regulatory bodies conduct strict audits to ensure that IFU documents meet MDR standards, covering aspects such as clarity, accuracy, risk communication, and accessibility. Failure to comply can lead to serious consequences, including product recalls, fines, or even restrictions on market access.</p>
        <p>By prioritizing MDR-compliant IFU, manufacturers not only meet legal requirements but also build trust with users and regulators, ensuring their devices remain available in the European market. </p>
