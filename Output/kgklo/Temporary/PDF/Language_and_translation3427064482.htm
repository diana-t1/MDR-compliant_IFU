        <p>Ensuring that IFU comply with the MDR 2017/745 requires careful attention to language and translation requirements. Since usually medical devices are used across multiple EU countries, MDR mandates that IFU must be available in the official languages of the Member States, or other approved there languages, where the device is marketed. This ensures that healthcare professionals and patients can fully understand the instructions, reducing the risk of misuse or safety incidents.</p>
        <p>The <b>overview of language requirements</b> for manufacturers of medical devices issued by European Commission is available at <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/publications/overview-language-requirements-manufacturers-medical-devices_en" alt="Link to European Commision website, page: Overview of language requirements for manufacturers of medical devices" class="ExternalLink">health.ec.europa.eu</a>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Each country within the EU has the authority to define its own language requirements, meaning manufacturers must <b>verify the specific regulations for each market</b>. While some Member States allow IFU in English for professional users, others require full translations into the national language(s). This is particularly important for patient-facing devices, where clear and accurate translations are essential for safe usage.</p>
        <p>To meet MDR standards, translations must be precise, consistent, and medically accurate. Poor translations can lead to misinterpretation of safety warnings, incorrect device usage, or regulatory non-compliance. MDR encourages the use of <b>internationally recognized symbols</b> to enhance clarity and minimize language barriers.</p>
        <p>With the rise of electronic IFU (e-IFU), digital formats must also comply with language accessibility requirements. Some Member States have specific rules regarding <b>graphical user interfaces (GUI)</b>, ensuring that digital instructions are available in the appropriate language. If illustrations of GUI are to be presented in the IFU, this should be taken into account when creating the different language versions of the IFU.</p>
        <p>Not only the specifics of the device, but also the number of markets in which the device will be sold, and thus the number of translations, should guide the selection of the <b>right tools</b> for IFU creation. Implementing suitable <b>document management system (DMS)</b> can optimise not only the creation but also future updating of the IFU.</p>
