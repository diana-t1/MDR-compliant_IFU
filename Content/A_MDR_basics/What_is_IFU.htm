        <h1>What is IFU?</h1>
        <p><b>Instructions for Use (IFU)</b> are an essential part of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR), ensuring that medical devices are used correctly and safely. Think of them as a guidebook – not just a technical document, but a crucial tool that helps healthcare professionals and patients make informed decisions. MDR has raised the bar for IFU requirements, demanding that these instructions be clear, accessible, and detailed.</p>
