        <h1>What is MDR?</h1>
        <p>The Medical Device Regulation (MDR) is a set of rules established by the European Union (EU) to ensure the safety, quality, and effectiveness of medical devices used within the EU market. It replaced the previous Medical Device Directive (MDD) and introduced stricter requirements for manufacturers, distributors, and healthcare providers.</p>
        <p>Key aspects of MDR:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <p class="bold">Stronger patient safety measures</p> – MDR enforces more rigorous testing and clinical evaluations to ensure medical devices meet high safety standards.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <p class="bold">Enhanced transparency &amp; traceability</p> – Devices must be registered in EUDAMED, an EU-wide database, to improve tracking and post-market surveillance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <p class="bold">Clearer classification system</p> – MDR introduces new risk-based classifications, meaning some devices now require stricter regulatory approval.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <p class="bold">Improved labeling &amp; instructions for use (IFU)</p> – Manufacturers must provide detailed, user-friendly IFU to ensure proper device usage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <p class="bold">Stricter oversight of notified bodies</p> – Organizations responsible for certifying medical devices must meet higher competency standards.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
