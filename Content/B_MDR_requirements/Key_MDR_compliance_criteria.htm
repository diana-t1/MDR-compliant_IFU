        <h1>Key MDR compliance criteria</h1>
        <p> MDR specifies requirements for information supplied with the device in <b>Annex I, Chapter III,</b> outlining the essential details that must appear on the device itself, its packaging, and within the IFU.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Clear and understandable language</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>IFU should be written in <b>simple, understandable language</b>, considering the user’s technical knowledge, experience, and training. Where necessary, <b>visual aids</b> such as diagrams and illustrations should be included to improve comprehension.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Every IFU should define the <b>device’s purpose</b>, outlining who should use it, when it should be used, and any indications or contraindications to be aware of. Safety is paramount, so IFU must also highlight <b>potential risks</b>, side effects, and warnings, allowing users to take the right precautions. MDR also requires performance <b>specifications</b>, ensuring that professionals know exactly what to expect from the device and how to verify its suitability.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>For implantable or reusable devices, IFU must go even further, detailing the <b>materials used, how to clean, disinfect, and reprocess</b> them, and when they should no longer be reused. Devices that need assembly, sterilization, or calibration must have <b>step-by-step guidance</b> to prevent errors. If a device emits radiation, IFU must provide protective measures to minimize exposure risks.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>IFU must clearly communicate <b>residual risks, listing warnings, contraindications, and precautions</b> to ensure user safety. Where appropriate, <b>internationally recognized symbols</b> should be used in place of long descriptions, provided they conform to harmonized standards.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>IFU must be kept up to date and readily accessible, including on the manufacturer’s website, to ensure users always have access to the latest safety and performance information. These requirements emphasize user-friendly design, transparency, and safety, ensuring that medical devices can be used effectively and without unnecessary risk.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Every IFU must inform users that serious incidents related to the device must be reported to both the manufacturer and relevant authorities.</p>
