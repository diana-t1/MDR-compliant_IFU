        <h1>Applicable medical device classes</h1>
        <p>Under the Medical Device Regulation (MDR), medical devices are classified based on their risk level, which directly impacts the requirements for Instructions for Use (IFU). The classification system ensures that devices with higher risks undergo stricter regulatory scrutiny, including more detailed IFU requirements.</p>
        <p>Medical devices are divided into four main classes: Class I, Class IIa, Class IIb, and Class III. Class I devices, such as bandages or thermometers, pose the lowest risk and often require minimal instructions, focusing on basic usage instructions. Class IIa and IIb devices, including infusion pumps and diagnostic equipment, require more comprehensive instructions to ensure safe operation and risk mitigation. Class III devices, such as implantable pacemakers or heart valves, carry the highest risk and must have highly detailed instructions for use, covering clinical benefits, contraindications, and precise usage guidelines. </p>
        <p>According to MDR 2017/745 Annex I, Chapter III, Class I and IIa devices may be exempt from IFU if they can be used safely without them.</p>

        <p>MDR also emphasizes electronic IFU (e-IFU) for certain high-risk devices, allowing manufacturers to provide digital instructions while ensuring accessibility and compliance. </p>
