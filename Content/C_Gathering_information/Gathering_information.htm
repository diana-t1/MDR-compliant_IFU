        <h1>Gathering information</h1>
        <p>Creating IFU that comply with MDR requires a structured approach to gathering information. The process should begin with identifying key regulatory requirements, such as those outlined in Annex I, Chapter III of MDR, which specify what must be included in IFU, from safety warnings to performance characteristics (see <MadCap:xref href="../B_MDR_requirements/Key_MDR_compliance_criteria.htm" class="InsideLinks">Key MDR compliance criteria</MadCap:xref>). Manufacturers must also stay updated on guidelines from regulatory bodies and any recent amendments to MDR that could impact IFU content.</p>
        <p>Beyond regulations, gathering information involves <b>collaborating with experts</b>. Regulatory affairs specialists must ensure IFU align with legal requirements, while technical writers can focus on making instructions clear and user-friendly. Healthcare professionals and clinical experts can provide insights into real-world device usage, helping refine IFU to address practical concerns. Additionally, manufacturers must consider <b>language accessibility</b>, ensuring IFU are available in the official languages of the countries  (or other approved languages) where the device is marketed.</p>
        <p>Another crucial aspect is <b>post-market surveillance</b> – manufacturers must <b>continuously update IFU</b> based on user feedback, safety reports, and regulatory audits. This ensures that IFU remain accurate, relevant, and compliant over time. With the rise of electronic IFU (e-IFU), digital formats are becoming more common, improving accessibility and usability while reducing paper waste. </p>
